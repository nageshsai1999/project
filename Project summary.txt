Why : In frontend part I used Angular framwork beacuase it is single page application and developed by google
Project : In Restaurent app 
Web pages like 
	login, 
	register, 
	home, 
	menu and after login and register it'll show Cart page 
Register Part: We add userDetails in mySQL database using node with mysql setup
Login Part: Verify user and user able to add item into cart
Menu Page: Fetching Data from Database and showing in menu page
Cart Page: after login user able to add item in cart through menu page

Node+MySQL setup did CRUD operation for user and item 

MySQL :
Database name: restaurentApp
Table: 
userDetails : for storing user details and created necessary column for that
MenuDetails: for Storing menuItem Details and created necessary column for that
